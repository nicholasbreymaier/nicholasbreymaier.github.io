        "A place, ranging from a neighborhood-scale to nation-scale geographic area, is referred to as automobile dependent, or car dependent, when the only means by which residents are realistically capable of reaching necessities is by driving a personal automobile. By necessities we mean any locations necessary to live a successful life in modern society, such as institutions of education, jobs, and grocery stores.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis will focus prinarily on automobile dependency in the United States, but data from other countries will be used for comparative purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Importance of Automobile Dependency\n",
        "Some of the information presented in this section is drawn directly from the datasets we analyze in this project, and will be cited as such. Please see the bibliography at the end of this document/website for sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Relevance in the Field of Data Science\n",
        "Coverage by the major media institutions in the United States fails to correlate with what Americans die from (!cite 1). Among other things, the need for major media institutions to \"keep up\" with the incessant and immediate news which is able to be transmitted via social media has lead to institutions (!cite) switching to more eyecatching topics to maintain viewership and therefore advertisement revenue. Relying on the media is therefore not an effective way to build public awareness about systemic problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Science offers a promising alternative medium of news coverage as opposed to televised reports transmitted by major media corporations and news transmitted via social media because it is significantly less prone to outlier bias. This project hopes to demonstrate that data science can be used to generate awareness about important yet overlooked societal issues by doing so with car dependency."

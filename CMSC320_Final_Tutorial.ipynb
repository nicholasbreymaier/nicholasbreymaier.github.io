        "# Introduction\n",
        "A place, ranging from a neighborhood-scale to nation-scale geographic area, is referred to as <a href='https://www.planetizen.com/definition/automobile-dependency'>automobile dependent</a>, or car dependent, when the only means by which residents are realistically capable of reaching necessities is by driving a personal automobile. By necessities we mean any locations necessary to live a successful life in modern society, such as institutions of education, jobs, and grocery stores. For the purposes of this analysis, the term 'car' or 'automobile' includes standard sedans and station wagons as well as vans and <a href='https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-86/subpart-A/section-86.082-2'>light-duty trucks</a> such as Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project serves as an analysis of some of the conseqeuences of and alternatives to car dependency in the United States over time for the purpose of raising awareness, but is by no means meant to be a comprehensive review of the subject. For readers who are interested in learning more about the causes of car dependency and how to fix it, we strongly encourage that you do more research on the subject; the \"Further Information for Interested Readers\" section at the bottom of this webpage may serve as a good place to start.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will focus primarily on automobile dependency in the United States, but data from other countries will be used for comparative purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Importance of Automobile Dependency in the United States\n",
        "Over <a href='https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics'>90%</a> of households in the United States (US) owned at least one car in 2021, with more than <a href='https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics/'>59%</a> owning two or more cars owing to the commonness of married couples having seperate jobs. In 2015, over <a href='https://www.bts.gov/content/commute-mode-share-2015'>80%</a> of commutes were taken by car, as were <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/what-if-more-people-bought-groceries-online-instead-driving-store\">88%</a> of grocery store trips. As of 2019, over <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-07/how-distance-to-school-affects-student-well-being#:~:text=Today%2C%20nearly%2060%20percent%20of,especially%20on%20sleep%20and%20exercise.'>60%</a> of students in primary and secondary education are driven to school. These trends arise because the vast majority of Americans simply have no other choice but to reach their destinations by driving, whether this be due to distance<a href='https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1006/ML100621425.pdf'>—the average commute is 15 miles—</a>or to lack of safety, which we address below. In both of these cases, there is a severe lack of safe, long distance alternatives such as <a href='https://www.apta.com/news-publications/public-transportation-facts/'>public transportation</a>. In other words, the United States <a href='https://www.vox.com/22662963/end-driving-obsession-connectivity-zoning-parking'>is car dependent</a>.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is problematic for <a href ='https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/1/20/the-negative-consequences-of-car-dependency#:~:text=Living%20in%20a%20car%20dependent,)%20and%20indirect%20(taxes.)'>many reasons</a>, the most dire of which are environmental, financial, and mortal—that is, deadly. We are in the middle of the <a href='https://www.who.int/health-topics/climate-change#tab=tab_1'>climate crisis</a> scientists have been warning us of for decades, with a dire and immediate need to halt carbon emissions and find ways to help the ecosphere heal from the damage we've already done. In the midst of this, with transportation being the <a href='https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions'>largest contributor</a> to the US's carbon output, the US Department of Transportation is still <a href='https://highways.dot.gov/federal-lands/projects/by-state'>building and widening</a> highways in <a href='https://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf'>futile</a> attempts to relieve incessant conjestion brought about by people having no alternatives to driving, the very construction process of which emits grand quantities of greenhouse gases. This project analyzes the financial and mortal costs of car dependency in the US in more detail below.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Relevance in the Field of Data Science\n",
        "Coverage of causes of death by major media institutions in the United States <a href='https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from'>fails to correlate</a> with what Americans die from, with automobile fatalities and pollution induced illnesses being covered at significantly lower proportions than the proportion of deaths they cause. This is likely due in part to the need for major media companies to \"keep up\" with the incessant and immediate news which is able to be transmitted via social media, which has lead to companies disproportunately covering eye catching topics like homicide and terrorism to maintain viewership and therefore advertisement revenue. This is part of a larger <a href='https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/media-consolidation-means-less-local-news-more-right-wing-slant'>trend</a> wherein media consolidation into the hands of large corporations causes news stations to prioritize national news as opposed to local news, and often leads to right-wing political slant in coverage. Moreover, major US news corporations increasingly fail to critically examine institutions in relation to societal problems, opting to either not discuss them at all or to atomize important events which are symptoms of larger problems, as may be seen in the coverage of the recent East Palestine <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Ohio_train_derailment'>train derailment</a>. Relying on the media is therefore not an effective way to build public awareness about systemic, societal problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Science offers a promising alternative medium of news coverage as opposed to major media corporations and news transmitted via social media because it is significantly <a href='https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/'>less prone to outlier bias</a>. It is capable of analyzing long-term macro-level trends that would take the culmination of thousands of traditional articles to reveal, much less communicate, and may be seen as more democratic than the privately owned media corporations which currently dominate the US news landscape. Anyone with the requisite knowledge, a computer, and internet access can use data science to bring issues to light. This project hopes to demonstrate that data science can be used to generate awareness about important yet overlooked societal issues by using it to do so with car dependency."
